# Core Principles & Architecture

## Architecture
- **Single Vite application** with TypeScript and React 19
- **Feature-based component organization** in `src/components/feature/`
- **Common reusable components** in `src/components/common/`
- **Client-side only** - no server dependencies or backend API calls
- **Lazy loading** for tool components to optimize bundle size

## Design Philosophy
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with consistent breakpoint usage
- **Dark mode by default**: Use `color-scheme: dark` with light text on dark backgrounds
- **Use Radix UI as the base component library** for Tailwind CSS compatibility
- **Extend Radix UI components with Tailwind utility classes** for styling
- **Leverage Radix UI's unstyled components** for maximum Tailwind flexibility
