# Code Standards

## TypeScript
- **Always use TypeScript with strict mode**
- Prefer type inference when possible, explicit types when clarity needed
- Use proper interfaces for object shapes
- **Avoid `any` type, use `unknown` or proper types**
- Export types alongside implementation when creating reusable components

## File Naming & Structure
- **Use kebab-case for file names** (e.g., `app-version.ts`)
- **Use PascalCase for component files** (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`)
- **Use camelCase for utilities and hooks** (e.g., `useAppVersion.ts`)
- Group related files in feature directories
- Use index.ts files for clean exports

## Code Organization
- **Keep components focused and single-responsibility**
- **Extract custom hooks for reusable logic**
- **Feature-based organization**: Each tool has its own directory in `src/components/feature/`
- **Type organization**: Types organized in `src/types/` with feature-specific subdirectories
- **Hook organization**: Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` with feature grouping
- **Consistent import ordering**: External dependencies → internal modules → relative imports
- **Index file exports**: Use `index.ts` files for clean re-exports and barrel patterns
- **Lazy loading imports**: Use dynamic imports for tool components to optimize bundle splitting
